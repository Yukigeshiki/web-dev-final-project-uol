      <h3 class="report-sub-title">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="report-paragraph">
        In my website I have tried to convey a sense of warm friendliness. I
        have attempted to acheive this by making UI that doesn't confuse or
        overpower the users senses. I've kept the layout as minimal and clean as
        possible without it seeming bland or empty of content. I have gone with
        a Hierarchical Model as I felt this was the best way to acheive a sense
        of ease while moving through the site; I've tried to make sure that the
        user has full control over where they would like to navigate without
        being pushed towards any one area.
      </p>
      <h3 class="report-sub-title">
        State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First and foremost I was inspired by my lifelong love of succulent
          plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, my love for minimal and clean design - not just with regards
          to websites, but in all aspects of art and design.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, I was inspired by my hope that I will eventually be able to
          create a production ready website for my succulent plants.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="report-sub-title">
        State 3 ways in which your site is accessible
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I have tried to lay out all links in a well spread out and easy to
          navigate manner when using only a keyboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have made every attempt at making the site visually appealing and
          easy to navigate on screens of any size.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have used a color scheme that I hope will not cause those who are
          visually impaired or color blind to struggle when viewing the site.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="report-sub-title">
        State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I have attempted to keep the design clean from unnecessary
          distractions so the user can navigate the site with ease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of inlining large pieces of text, I have given the user the
          opportunity to open the text in a new tab. This prevents the site from
          becoming crowded and making it difficult for a user's eyes to
          navigate.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have tried to separate out each piece of subject matter, eg. events,
          so that the user can easily find what they are looking for without
          having to sift through unrelated items.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="report-sub-title">
        State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your
        site, and describe how you did that
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I had to learn how to access a javascript object holding data within
          my HTML file, and then pass pieces of that data into another
          javascript function as a paramater. I learnt this by searching google
          for articles and code examples relating to how HTML and javascript
          interact.
        </li>
        <li>
          I had to learn how to open an HTML file and then write data to it
          using a javascript function, depending on what link was clicked. I
          learnt how to do this by researching aspects of the DOM using google.
        </li>
        <li>
          I had to learn how to change my top nav items into a drop down menu
          when the screen became small. This I did by adapting the W3Schools
          menu to suit my sites needs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="report-sub-title">
        What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?
      </h3>
      <p class="report-paragraph">
        A few come to mind; first of all I really enjoyed how the images helped
        to light up the pages and make my attempt at a minimal design seem less
        dull. Other than that I was really glad that the inserted videos worked
        out nicely. I feel they add an extra something that the site wouldn't
        have without them. Lastly, I think the welcome page added to the overall
        feel of the site by starting the user on a clean, bright note.
      </p>
      <h3 class="report-sub-title">
        What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do
        things differently another time?
      </h3>
      <p class="report-paragraph">
        Next time round I would definitely put more thought into how my designs
        can be implemented rather than just designing and hoping that the
        implementation will just work without any problems. Also, now that I
        have had experience attempting to make my site fully responsive there
        are aspects that I would redesign in a way that made responsiveness
        easier to achieve. There are also Javascript elements that I had planned
        but had to leave out because I ran out of time; because of what I have
        learnt this time round, I feel implementing them would now be possible.
        I have tried my best to provide meaningful content but again ran out of
        time - knowing what I know now about how long certain things took to
        implement, I may have changed out certain things that were content heavy
        for something else. This would be to minimise the amount of dummy
        content I landed up having to use.
      </p>
      <h3 class="report-sub-title">
        What resources were used when creating your work?
      </h3>
      <p class="report-paragraph">
        I used my store of photographs of my plants for all images. I used a mix
        of the W3Schools website, Code Pen website, Stack Overflow and Medium
        articles for research and inspiration pertaining to HTML, UI/UX design,
        Javascript and CSS. Items taken from other sources were the main setup
        for my CSS, the drop down menu used for the on smaller screens, the
        slideshow, and the login/signup pages. The CSS was taken from Udemy and
        adapted to fit the needs of my page. The drop down menu was taken from
        W3School and was modified by making all nav items dissapear when the
        screen is too small to fit each item (the original still showed the home
        nav item). I also changed all styling to fit with the theme of my site.
        The slideshow was also modified from code found on W3School. In this
        case I removed all the extras as I wanted them to fit into the minimal
        design of the site. The styling was also drastically changed to make it
        more bold and to fill the extent of the screen width. The login/signup
        page was taken from Code Pen. I removed all the javascript as I didn't
        think I would find the time to hook it up to anything worth while. I
        also changed the styling to fit in with the site and I added javascript
        code so that the Login nav item changed to Logout when the login button
        is clicked.
